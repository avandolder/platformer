# Platformer

"Platformer" was an attempt at creating a 2D sidescroller using C++ and SFML
that I worked on in 2014. I believe it was my first time using OOP in a
fairly large project.

I learned a number of things when working on this project, especially when it
came to implementing scripting languages (for example Lua) in a program.

Unfortunately, after experiencing difficulties in attempting to create a basic
physics engine, I abandoned this project about a month after starting it.
